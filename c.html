           <p  style="text-align: left;">
            C Language is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications.

           <h2 class="h-about"> What makes learning it important? </h2>
           <p style="text-align: left;">C Language is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded softwares. Applications include graphics packages, word processors, spreadsheets, operating system development, database systems, compilers and assemblers, network drivers and interpreters.</p>

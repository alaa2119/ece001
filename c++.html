           <p  style="text-align: left;">
            C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.        </p>   
        
               
           <h2 class="h-about"> What makes learning it important? </h2>
           <p style="text-align: left;">The C++ language is used to create computer programs and packaged software, such as games, office applications, graphics and video editors and operating systems.</p>

                            •	The Blackberry OS is developed using C++.
                        <br>  •	The newest Microsoft Office suite was developed using C++.

                  <p style="text-align: left;">
                    o	Often the first programming language taught at college level
                   <br> o	Quick processing and compilation mechanism
                   <br> o	Robust standard library (STL)

           <h2 class="h-about"> Where did it start? </h2>
           <p style="text-align: left;">
            Released in 1983 and often considered an object-oriented version of C language, C++ was created to compile lean, efficient code, while providing high-level abstractions to better manage large development projects.
